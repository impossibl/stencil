<h1>Extensions</h1>

<p>
	Stencil supports easily extending its features with code written in Java.
</p>


<h2>Simple</h2>
<p>
	Since Stencil's <a href="expressions.html">expression</a> language can access
	any Java method usually the easiest way to extend Stencil is to pass in a Java
	object with the methods you like to use.
	
	{% highlight java %}
	StencilEngine engine = new StencilEngine();
	
	Map<String,Object> params = new HashMap<>();
	params.put("myCustomObject", new MyCustomObject());
	
	engine.render("myTemplate.st", params);
	
	{% endhighlight %}
	
	While rendering the template then has access to any methods defined on the MyCustomObject class.
</p>

<h2>Advanced</h2>
<p>
	Sometimes more advanced integration is needed or wanted. To do that you can implement one or both of 
	the extension interfaces to handle calling and block passing. In API parlance "block passing" is known
	as "preparation".
</p>
<p>
	Once you've implemented the interface you can simply pass the implementations into Stencil as parameters,
	provide them through <a href="engine-api.html">globals</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Function Calling
	{% highlight java %}
	public interface Callable {
	  
	  public static final String ALL_PARAM_NAME = "*";
	
		String[] getParameterNames();
		Object call(Map<String,?> params) throws Throwable;
		
	}
	{% endhighlight %}
	
	Implement this interface is as easy as providing a list of parameters your extension will accept when called
	and providing the functionality in the call method.
</p>
<p>
	NOTE: Using the ALL_PARAM_NAME will allow you to receive any and all parameters passed to the method.
	<a href="macros.html#blocks">See Parameters</a> for more information
</p>
<p>
	Preparation
	{% highlight java %}
	public interface Preparable {
	  
	  public static final String ALL_BLOCK_NAME = "*";
	  public static final String UNNAMED_BLOCK_NAME = "+";
	
		String[] getBlockNames();
		Object prepare(Map<String,?> params) throws Throwable;
		
	}
	{% endhighlight %}

	Implement this interface is as easy as providing a list of blocks your extension will accept when prepared
	and providing the functionality in the prepare method.
</p>
<p>
	NOTE: Using the ALL_PARAM_NAME will allow you to receive any and all parameters passed to the method.
	<a href="macros.html#blocks">See Blocks</a> for more information
</p>
<p>
	NOTE: Using the UNNAMED_BLOCK_NAME will allow you to receive an unnamed block if one was passed.
