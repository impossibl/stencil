<h1>Syntax</h1>
<p>
	Stencil's syntax is designed to reduce typing as much as possible and to feel like the
	text and output commands are naturally woven together.
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
	All text in a Stencil template is output without modification. Only <a href="outputs.html">outputs</a> are processed
	by the template engine.	
</p>

<p>
	To begin a dynamic section you always use the '$' and to end it you always use the ';'.
	
	<pre>
		$myVal;
	</pre>
</p>

<p>
	Different output commands can take "Blocks" of text to define a block you wrap it in 
	'{' and '}'.
	<pre>
		$if x {
			This text is in a block
		};
		
		$if y { This text is too }
	</pre>
</p>

<p>
	Some commands, and user defined macros, can take more than one block.
	<pre>
		$if x {
			This text is in a block
		}
		else {
			A second block
		};
	</pre>
</p>
<p>
	That's the basics!
	<br/>

	You can read all the details about outputs, expressions, functions, macros, etc. using the
	syntax reference at the right.
